## From Developer Zero
**What is this?**

This is a simple project I started a while ago to help learn how to use vim, python and github. It has changed a bit from it's original form, and is now an attempt to create a version of the game Pandemic with AI players who try to complete the game, and is now written in Java rather than python.
